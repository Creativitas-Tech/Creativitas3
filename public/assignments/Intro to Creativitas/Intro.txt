Welcome to Creativitas! This first assignment is going to go over the first elements of programming you will want to know, and help you begin making music.

Watch [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/Z2zUCg7gA6c), and as you are watching copy the code from the video into the codebox below. Things you will want to make sure you are able to do:
* open the javascript console in Chrome (note: Chrome is the best supported website for this)
* execute a single line of code
* create sequences for a synthesizer using `s.sequence`

Once you have finished watching the video, create four sequences of you own using four lines of coding using `s.sequence()`. You can think of these sequences as parts of a song (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.), or just as sections of a longer melody. Try switching between sequences by executing each sequence individually.

When you are done, click 'Export Code' and select 'Text File' to download your code. Be prepared to show your melodies to the class!
