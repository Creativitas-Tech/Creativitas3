MIDI note messages are based on the model of a piano keyboard, with a note on message being sent when a key is pressed, and a note off message being sent when a key is released.

We will define a function to handle incoming MIDI note messages. Follow along with [this video](https://youtu.be/5CPpUbzklOQ) to see how this works. After watching the video, you should be able to:
* implement `setNoteOnHandler()` and a `setNoteOffHandler()`
* use if() statements in order to take an action in response to a specific MIDI note being pressed and released
* enable your laptop keyboard to function as a MIDI controller
