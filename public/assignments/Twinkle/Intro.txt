The Twinkle synthesizer is a simple subtractive synth. These have the signal flow: `oscillator -> filter -> amplifier`. The controls in this synth are:

1. Oscillator (VCO): you can select the waveform
2. Filter (VCF): you can change the cutoff, resonance, and env depth
3. Amplifier (VCA): the amplitude is normally controlled by the envelope. However, you can also manually turn the amplitude up using the 'level' knob, which will add to the envelope output.
4. Envelope (ADSR): The envelope is an attack-decay-sustain-release envelope, and controls both the VCA amplitude and the VCF cutoff. 

There are also a few sequencer controls in this example, found below the s.sequence() line.
* s.octave sets the octave of the synth
* s.velocity sets the velocity of the sequenced notes
* s.sustain sets the sustain time for the ADSR when the sequencer plays a note.
