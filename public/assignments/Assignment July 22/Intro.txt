*Due July 23*

For today our goal is to get comfortable programming our Barre controllers to respond to MIDI note and CC messages.

In the code box below is a simple example showing how to do two things:
* create sequences when a specific MIDI note is played
* control synth parameters with CC messages

For tomorrow, modify the code below so that every MIDI note triggers a function - the easiest thing to do is to create a new sequence (like the code below does). But you can also stop the sequencer, change octaves, change synth parameters, etc.

In addition, modify the code so that your Barre controls two synth parameters using CC 0 and CC 1. I gave a simple example but you should think about your own idea and try it out. 

A few notes:
* don't forget to look at your console and see which MIDI input and output your Barre is using. You should see either 'Wifiduino' or 'Tiny USB'. Make sure `setMidiInput()` and `setMidiOutput()`  use the right MIDI port.
* your pads should trigger a pink flash - if the pink flash is not happening and you are not receiving MIDI notes try executing the line `sendCC(101,1)`. This will send a CC message to the Barre and reset the capacitive touch controller.
* make sure your console is open (right-click the codebox, select inspect, and then select the console). It helps so much to see when you make typos or other errors pop up.
* if you get stuck don't worry too much - we will go over everything tomorrow and we will help you figure it out!
