### Getting started with synths and sequencers

Watch [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/sWS7U29qszY) to learn about the basics of sequencing in Creativitas. Be sure to enter the code from the video in the code box below.

Things you will want to know after this assignment:
* how to use brackets [] to make divisions of a beat
* how to create rests
* how to change the speed of the sequence using notation like '4n'
* how to make chords in a single sequence
* how to make multiple sequences control the same synthesizer (note the use of the `Polyphony()` object)

Once you have finished the video, create a song with two sections. Think about the elements of a song: melody, bassline, chords - you don't have to use every element but you might want to! Save your song by downloading the code as a text file, and be prepared to share it.
