### Sequencing
Some key points about creating a sequence:
* the sequence must be inside quotes ''
* brackets [ ] let you put more than one note in a beat
* if notes are comma separated in brackets they will play at the same time
  * this lets you play chords
* a period '.' is a rest
* the sequence method has three possible arguments:
  * The sequence itself
  * The playback rate, e.g. 8n or 4
  * The sequence number, 0 by default.
* each sequence has properties:
  * octave: transposes the sequence
  * sustain: sets how long the envelope stays in the sustain phase
  * velocity: how loud the sequence is
  * strum: the dealy when notes are played at the same time
