Examples of simple algorithms for generating musical patterns.
* also see the markov chain example

function euc(numHits, numBeats, rotation)
* distributes numHits across numBeats as evenly as possible
* and rotates the resulting sequence
* e.g euc(3,8,0) gives [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]

Using waveforms to generate melodies
* sin(), tri(), random()
* or i%n/n for a sawtooth!
* try combining waves, or doing internal modulation
* e.g. sin(i*PI*x) + sin(i*PI*y)
* e.g. sin(i*PI*x + sin(i*PI*y)*a) //frequency modulation
