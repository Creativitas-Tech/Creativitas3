*Due July 24*

As discussed in class, your assignment for tonight is to create a really terrible first draft of a song. Nothing you do for this assignment needs to be used on friday - but make a good attempt and see what you come up with!

A few tips:
* Don't forget you can make multiple sequences by using a 3rd value in .sequence, e.g. `s.sequence('0','8n',0)` makes sequence number 0
* You can also stop your sequence `s.stop()` or stop an individual sequence `s.stop(0)`
* Try adding a DrumSampler to you piece! Just add:
```
let d = new DrumSampler()
d.connect(output)
d.initGui()
```
* You can also add `Distortion()`, `Chorus()`, `Delay()`, or `Reverb()`. Each have their own GUI!
