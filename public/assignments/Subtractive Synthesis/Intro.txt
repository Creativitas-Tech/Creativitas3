### Getting started with synths and sequencers

We are going to be using lots of subtractice synthesizers - which are synthesizers which use filters and oscillators to create interesting timbres.

Watch [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/pbl8VSWjgLQ) to learn about how the Twinkle synthesizer works, and about subtractive synthesis more generally.

Things you will want to know after this assignment:
* what different oscillator types sound like
* how the cutoff frequency of a filter affects the sound
* how resonance or Q works
* what an attack, decay, sustain, release envelope is.

Once you have finished the video, play around with twinkle and see what kind of sounds you can make!
