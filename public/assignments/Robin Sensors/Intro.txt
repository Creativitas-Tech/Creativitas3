This started code won't make any sound by itself, but it will print note on and off messages to the console and graph the accelerometer data.
- normally you won't graph all of the CC data like this, but it can be helpful to understand the sensor data

* Accel x, y, z (orange): raw accelerometer data
* Tilt (blue): pitch, roll, yaw
* Magnitude (pink color): total acceleration of all 3 axes
* Touch Strip (green): capitance when you touch the long strip on robin
* Potentiometer (purple): changes when you turn the potentiometer
