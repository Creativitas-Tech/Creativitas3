## Objects
Once the object's form is defined, you create a new instance by calling `new Object`
### Constructor
Every object has a constructor method, which is called when the object is created. This is a time to pass in important properties of the object in the form of arguments.
### Methods
Methods are called using the objectName.method() syntax. Treat them just like functions!
### The `this` keyword
Inside of an object, we use `this` to make sure the object knows where to look for properties and methods. Get used to using it *inside object definitions* - see the example for what this looks like.
