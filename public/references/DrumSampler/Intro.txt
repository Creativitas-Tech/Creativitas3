The DrumSampler object loads a bank of soundfiles and lets you easily sequence and manipulate them. The samples themselves come from the Tone.js example files, and are mostly drawn from other open-source projects.

Each bank consists of:
* Kick Drum (played with 'O'/loud of 'o'/soft)
* Snare Drum (played with 'X'/loud of 'x'/soft)
* Closed hihat (played with '*')
* Open hihat (played with '^') - actually is the same sample as closed hihat but with a longer envelope
* Percussion 1 (p1) (played with '1'). Generally a high tom sample
* Percussion 2 (p2) (played with '2'). Generally a medium tom sample
* Percussion 3 (p3) (played with '3'). Generally a low tom sample
