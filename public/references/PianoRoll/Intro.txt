The **Piano Roll Visualizer** is a simple display for showing musical eventsacross a fixed window, similar in spirit to DAW piano rolls such as Ableton Live. The vertical axis is pictures and the horizontal access is beats. The default view is for eight beats, but this can be modified. 

To use the piano roll, first create it as a standalone object, and then assigned sequences to it using the sequencers' .pianoroll method. 

Click and drag vertically to move the view window. Notes out of range are drawn on the bottom or top row.
