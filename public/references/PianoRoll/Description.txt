## Constructor Parameters

- **`numBeats`**  
  The number of beats displayed horizontally in the piano roll window. This defines the visible time span before notes wrap or are cleared.

- **`height`**  
  The vertical size of the piano roll. The default value is 1. 

- **`color`**  
  The base color used for drawing note events. Colors are internally normalized (e.g. to HSV) and may be modulated by velocity to control saturation or brightness.

- **`backgroundColor`**  
  The background color of the grid canvas.

## Core Methods

- **`clear(beatNumber = null)`**  
  Removes previously drawn notes.  
  - If `beatNumber` is `null`, all note events are cleared.  
  - If a beat number is provided, only notes in that beat are removed.

## Background Methods


- **`place(note, subdivision, duration, velocity)`**  
  Adds and draws a note event at a given pitch and time position.  
  - `note`: Pitch value (typically MIDI note number).  
  - `subdivision`: Time position in subdivisions relative to the start of the display window.  
  - `duration`: Length of the note in subdivisions.  
  - `velocity`: Normalized value (0–1) used to modulate visual intensity (e.g. saturation).  
  Notes are drawn immediately onto the note canvas without requiring a full redraw.
