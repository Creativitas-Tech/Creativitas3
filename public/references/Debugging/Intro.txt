What do you do when things don't work as expected?
* Try refreshing the page and trying again.
* Open the javascript console (search for how to do this for your browser) and see what messages are posted
* Try executing one line at a time and monitoring the console. This will help you identify which code is having problems

You can also `console.log()` any named element like variable, objects, or functions - just to see what they are doing
* Many objects have dedicated logging methods like:
* `s.get()` to log synth parameters

If you are experimenting with audio objects, try using an oscilloscope to monitor the output of individual audio objects.
* `s.connect( scope.input)` will connect an object to the scope
* `s.disconnect( scope.input)` will disconnect an object from the scope

It can also be helpful just to turn up the volume:
* `output.factor.value = .5` for the main output
* many synths have output value as well, e.g.
* `s.output.factor.value`
