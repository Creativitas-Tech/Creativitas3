# Getting Started with Creativitas

Welcome to Creativitas! This post is for anyone looking to explore sound synthesis and music programming using **Tone.js** and the **Web Audio API** through the Creativitas live coding environment.

Whether you're here to practice your JavaScript skills or dive into audio programming, Creativitas offers a flexible, responsive environment designed for experimentation, learning, and creative play.

## Using the Code Box

The Creativitas code box lets you enter JavaScript code directly into your browser. Here's how to get started:

- **Single-line execution:**  
  Press `Option + Enter` (macOS) or `Alt + Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run just the current line.

- **Multi-line block execution:**  
  Use `Option + Shift + Enter` (macOS) or `Alt + Shift + Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run a selected block of code.

⚠️ **Avoid pressing the “Run” button multiple times.** Doing so may cause unexpected behavior or audio conflicts. If something stops working, the easiest fix is often to **refresh the page**.

## Best Practices

- **Define audio objects only once.** Creating multiple identical `Tone.Synth`, `Tone.Player`, or `Tone.Loop` objects without clearing them can cause glitches or polyphony issues.
  
- **Variables can be redefined.** If you're adjusting parameters or trying different values, feel free to reassign variables freely.
