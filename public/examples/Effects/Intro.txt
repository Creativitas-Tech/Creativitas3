Audio effects are like guitar pedals, where plugging a synth into an effect changes the sound. We have four kinds of effects:
* A distortion module, which adds fuzz to the sound
* A chorus module, which thickens the sound
* A delay module to create echoes
* A reverb module to create ambience

Normally, you wouldn't put all of the effects on a single voice, but in this example we do just for demonstration. Try turning down the distortion drive, chorus mix, and reverb & delay level to hear more clearly what each one does. Then go crazy turning the knobs and make some fun sounds!
