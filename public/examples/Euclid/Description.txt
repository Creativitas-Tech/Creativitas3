### How Euclidean Rhythms Work

Euclidean rhythms solve a simple problem: how do you distribute X hits evenly across Y beats? The algorithm uses what's called the "bucket method" - imagine you have Y buckets and you pour X units of water into them as evenly as possible. When a bucket overflows, you place a hit at that position.

### Using the Built-in Method

The syntax is: `synth.euclid (sequence, hits, beats, rotation, subdivision, sequenceNumber)`

**Parameters:**
- `sequence` - The note/drum pattern to play (e.g., `'*'` for drums, `'0 2 4'` for melody)
- `hits` - Number of hits to distribute
- `beats` - Total number of beats
- `rotation` - How many steps to rotate the pattern (0 = no rotation)
- `subdivision` - Rhythmic subdivision ('16n', '8n', '4n')
- `sequenceNumber` - Which sequencer slot to use (0-9)
