The Twinkle synthesizer is a simple subtractive synth. The signal flow goes: `oscillator -> filter -> amplifier`. The controls in this synth are:

1. Oscillator (VCO): you can select the waveform
2. Filter (VCF): you can change the cutoff, resonance, and env depth
3. Amplifier (VCA): the amplitude is normally controlled by the envelope. However, you can also manually turn the amplitude up using the 'level' knob, which will add to the envelope output.
^#depriciated, no longer a level knob for amplitude in twinkle board
4. Envelope (ADSR): The envelope is an attack-decay-sustain-release envelope, and controls both the VCA amplitude and the VCF cutoff. 

There are also a few sequencer controls in this example, found below the s.sequence() line.
* s.octave sets the octave of the synth
* s.velocity sets the velocity of the sequenced notes
* s.sustain sets the sustain time for the ADSR when the sequencer plays a note.
