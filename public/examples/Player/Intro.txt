A sampler playback object based on Tone.Player.

For Player, the sequencer can either retrigger the sample at different points within the sample, or can control pitch of the sample
* `p.sequenceTime = false` to enable pitch control
* pitch control is a bit wonky - if you really want this a better option is to use the Simpler

When sequencing time, the sequencer value determines where in the audiofile the sample is played from 
* `p.baseUnit` determines how many chunks the audiofile is split into, and the sequencer value determines which chunk to play
* `p.baseUnit = 8` and `p.sequence('0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7')` plays the whole audiofile

Loading samples:
* use predefined samples (call p.listSamples() for the list)
* use a url to a cors compliant website
* call load() with no argument to upload a file from your computer
