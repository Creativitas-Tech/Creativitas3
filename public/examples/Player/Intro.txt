A sampler playback object based on Tone.Player.

For Player, the sequencer retriggers the sample at different points within the sample
* the sequence value determines where in the audiofile the sample is played from 
* `divisions` determines how many chunks the audiofile is split into, and the sequencer value determines which chunk to play
* `division = 8` and `p.sequence('0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7')` plays the whole audiofile

Loading samples:
* use predefined samples (call player.listSamples() for the list)
* use a url to a file stored on a `cors compliant` website
* call load() with no argument to upload a file from your computer
