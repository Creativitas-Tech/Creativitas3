* volume (0-1)
* playbackRate (normal=1): the playback speed of the sample as a ratio
* divisions (seconds): divisor to determine the playback position when sequencing time

* fadeIn (seconds): the fade in time of the sample
* fadeOut (seconds): the fade out time of the sample

* cutoff (Hz): the cutoff frequency of the built-in filter
* Q (0-20): the resonance/Q of the built-in filter
* filterType ('lowpass'/'highpass'): the type of the built-in filter
* filterEnvDepth (Hz): env modulation of the cutoff

* loopStart (seconds): where in the sample a loop starts
* loopEnd (seconds): where in the sample a loop ends
* loop (0/1/true/false): if the sample loops
